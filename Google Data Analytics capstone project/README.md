This project analyzes Fitbit user data to understand user behavior and identify opportunities to improve the company's marketing strategy.

# Data Source: 
Kaggle dataset containing anonymized Fitbit user data (steps, sleep, heart rate, activity intensity) from 30 individuals.

# Analysis Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and formatted data, including handling missing values and creating a "TotalActiveMinutes" column.
Data Modeling (Power BI): Created new calculated columns and tables for effective data relationships.
Data Analysis: Analyzed various aspects of user activity, sleep patterns, and correlations between factors.
Insights: Gained valuable insights into user behavior and activity patterns.

# Key Findings:
* Users are predominantly inactive (81.2%).
* A positive correlation exists between steps taken and calories burned.
* Users experience peak activity between 6 AM and 8 AM, noon-2 PM, and 5-7 PM, with a significant drop after 8 PM.
* Average sleep duration is 7 hours per night, with Sundays having the longest sleep times.

# Marketing Recommendations:
* Inactivity Timer: Implement a timer within the app to remind users to move after extended periods of inactivity.
* Fitness Challenge Groups: Introduce a feature allowing users to compete with friends or family in achieving weekly goals, especially on weekends. Offer digital rewards for winners to incentivize participation.
* Short Exercise Integration: Develop a feature suggesting short, intense exercises or jogging routines, particularly in the mornings (between 6 AM and 7 AM) when users tend to become active.
* Customer Satisfaction Surveys: Conduct weekly surveys based on tracked data to understand reasons behind user inactivity. This can help identify potential issues like illness.
* "User Nearby" Premium Feature: Introduce a premium feature allowing users to search for running partners in their vicinity. This fosters a sense of community and generates additional revenue.

By implementing these recommendations, Fitbit can address user behavior patterns and promote a more active lifestyle, ultimately leading to a more successful marketing strategy.
