Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the Power BI Data Analyst program in a comprehensive business setting. The scenario involved using real-world data from Tailwind Traders to create a sales and profit overview dashboard.

# Key Learnings:

Data cleaning and transformation techniques in Power BI
Data modeling concepts and relationships
DAX calculations for creating custom measures
Building effective visualizations to communicate insights
Creating interactive dashboards for decision-making
Report Contents:

The Power BI report consists of two main pages:

# Sales Overview: 
This page provides insights into key sales metrics such as quantity sold by product, median sales distribution by country, and loyalty points.
The Sales Overview page helps identify trends in customer buying habits and product performance. By visualizing loyalty points by country, we can see which regions have the most engaged customers. Similarly, the quantity sold by product chart reveals which products are most popular.

# Profit Overview: 
This page focuses on profitability metrics such as net revenue by product, yearly profit margin by country, and year-to-date profit.
The Profit Overview page helps assess the financial performance of Tailwind Traders. We can see which products generate the most revenue and which countries have the highest profit margins. The YTD Profit card displays the company's current profit year-to-date.
